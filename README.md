# pancanatlas_code_public
Public repository containing research code for the TCGA PanCanAtlas Splicing project accompanying
the manuscript *Comprehensive Analysis of Alternative Splicing Across Tumors from 8,705 Patients*

The code is organized in several sub-directories, which contain the following content:

**`alt_splice/event_stats`**
Code for visualising the event type distributions and number of alternative splicing events detected
per cancer type.

**`neoepitopes`**
Contains code for the visualization of results on the prediction of neo-epitopes.

**`sample_processing_rna`**
Code for pre-processing and alignment of the RNA-Seq data, including expression counting, the
collection of usage statistics, and construction of splicing graphs.
